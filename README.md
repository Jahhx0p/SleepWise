# SleepWise
SleepWise is an AI-based system designed to analyze and improve a userâ€™s sleep quality through sound analysis, movement patterns, and optional journaling. By passively monitoring audio (e.g., snoring, sleep talking, coughing) and movement using a smartphone placed near the bed, the system identifies sleep disturbances and classifies sleep stages.
